<h1>Laboratory Exercise on FILEs</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>  
<p>
  The goal of this lab is to introduce basic character, and string, input and
  output using files.
</p>

<h2>Part A: Revisiting Methods of Character and String Input</h2>

<h3><tt>gets</tt> vs <tt>getc</tt></h3>
<ol>
<li>Using <tt>getc</tt> write a simple program that gets the specified character of the terminal input "I love C!".
<li>Modify the program above to loop through and print the whole input that you enter.
<li>Now modify the program to print the whole input using <tt>gets</tt> and does not have loops.
</ol>

<h3>What is printf?</h3>
<ol start=4>
<li>
Explain the difference between <tt>printf</tt> and <tt>fprintf</tt>. 
<li>Which one would you use to write to a file?
<li>How would you use <tt>fprintf</tt> to write to standard output?
<li>Which is the easiest way to write to standard output?
</p>
</ol>

<h2>Part B: What You Can Do With Files</h2>

<h3>Some useful common utilities</h3>
<ol start=8>
<li><p>Write a small program that counts all the characters in a file. Your output should
give you how many letters, spaces, newlines, and other characters there are.</p>

<li><p>Write a program that will count how many words there are in your file.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
<ol start=10>
<li><p>Bioinformatics solves problems in biology with the use of computer science. </p>
<p>The file <a href=mouse_gene.txt>mouse_gene</a> has genetic data from a mouse. However the data is in a format that is not useful.</p>
<p> Write a C program that will take in this file as an input and will produce 4 files as an output. Each of the output files should contain a tag such as <tt>>AB000913 1</tt> that indicates different smaller genetic regions, and the genetic regions to which the tag corresponds.</p>
</ol>

<h3>A familiar Shell Program: <tt>cat</tt> </h3>
<ol start=11>
<li>
<p>
Write a small C program called <tt>mycat.c</tt> that reads a text file 
and prints its contents to <tt>stdout</tt>. You will likely find the C
library functions <tt>fgets</tt> and <tt>fputs</tt> (or <tt>puts</tt>)
useful. Recall that, in contrast with <tt>scanf</tt>, <tt>fgets</tt>
returns <tt>NULL</tt> when it encounters the end of the file.
For this initial exercise, you may hard code the name
of some file that already exists in your account as the input file. You may
assume that no line in the input file will contain more than 256
characters. Don't forget to close the file when you are done!
</p>

<p>
The output from your program should be similar to what you would get by
typing <tt>"cat infile"</tt> at the shell prompt, assuming a file named
<tt>infile</tt> exists in your directory. 
</p>

<li>
<p>
Modify your program so that it reads the name of the file from the
keyboard.  The program should give a useful error message if the specified
file does not exist.  
</p>

<p>
<i>Hint:</i>  Use the online manual to determine how <tt>fopen</tt> works
if the specified file is not present.  Recall that you can type <tt>man
  fopen</tt> to reference the online manual for this function.
</p>

</ol>
