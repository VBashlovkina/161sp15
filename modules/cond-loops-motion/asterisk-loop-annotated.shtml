<h1>asterisk-loop.c:  A basic program about nested loops</h1>

<p>
As a basic program about nested loops, consider the following code that
prints rows with increasing numbers of asteriskes.  Commentary after the
program explains each element of this program.
</p>
<hr>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main()
{
  int i, j;
  
  printf("Program to print rows with increasing numbers of asterisks.\n");

  for (i = 1; i &lt; 11; i++)
    {
      for (j = 0; j &lt; i; j++)
        {
        printf("*");
        }
      printf("\n");
    }

  return 0;
}

<h3>Commentary on the <code>asterisk-loop.c</code> program</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Nested loops are loops that have another loop in the first loop's
    body. This means that for every iteration of the outer loop, the inner
    loop is executed as a complete loop.
  </li>
  <li>When looking at nested loops, it is important that the inner
    loop must have its variables initialized inside the initialization
    statement. If this is not the case, then the first iteration of the outer
    loop leads to the inner loop variable(s) being changed, and upon the
    second iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop's continue
    expression depends on the old value of the variable(s) and may not
    cover the full range of cases desired. 
  </li>
  <li>In the current example, the inner loop is executed a
    certain number of times based on the outer loop, and a new line for the
    next row of asterisks is only included in the outer loop body.
  </li>
</ul>
