<h1>counting-loop.c: A basic program about loops</h1>

<p>
As a basic program about loops, consider the following code that prints the
numbers from one to ten, with each number on a new line.  Commentary after
the program explains each element of this program.  
</p>
<hr>
<pre>
/*
 * Program using a simple loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main()
{
  int i;

  printf("Program to print the numbers from 1 to 10.\n");

  for (i = 1; i < 11; i++)
    {
      printf("%d\n", i);
    }

  return 0;
}

<h3>Commentary on the <code>counting-loop.c</code> program</h3>

<p>A <code>for</code> loop is composed of an initializing statement, and
  a body of actions. The initializing statement has three components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loop Header<br>
    <p>Example: <code>for (i = 1; i &lt; 11; i++);</code>
      <ul>
        <li><i>variable initialization</i>
          <p>Example: <code>i = 1</code></p>
          <p>This line initializes one or more variables at the beginning of
            the loop. If multiple variables are initialized here, they are
            separated by commas. While it is not absolutely necessary to have a
            variable initialized here (the variable could be initialized earlier
            in the program), initializing the variable here means that the
            variable is predictable, as it has not been changed between being
            initialized and used in the loop. </p>
          <p>Note that while you can also declare the variable in this component
            (example: <code>int i = 1</code>), professional programmers
            disagree whether this is acceptable.</p>
        </li>
        <li><i>continuation expression(s)</i>
          <p>Example: <code>i &lt; 11</code></p>
          <p>This line determines whether the loop should continue. As long as
            the expression evaluates to true, the loop continues for another
            iteration. As with any logical expression, the continuation
            expression may include multiple subexpressions here, connected with
            &amp;&amp; (all subexpressions must be true) or || (at least one
            subexpression must be true).</p> 
          <p><b>Warning:</b> if the continue condition is not specified, the
            loop will not stop. Be careful!</p>
        </li>
        <li><i>loop action</i>
          <p>Example: <code>i++</code></p>
          <p>This line determines the action taken at the end of each iteration
            of the loop. In this program, after each time the program goes
            through the loop, the variable <code>i</code> is increased by one,
            then the continue condition is tested. If what is tested by the
            continue condition never changes, the loop will not finish.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loop Body
    <p>The C programming language treats the <code>for</code> loop body as
      a single unit. Either the body is composed of a single line, or the
      body of the <code>for</code> loop contains multiple commands enclosed
      by curly braces, which are also treated as a single unit.</p>
</ul>
