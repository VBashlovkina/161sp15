<h1>CSC 161 Module to Introduce Conditionals, Loops, and Scribbler 2 Motion</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This module introduces CSC 161 students to several fundamental elements of
programming in C, including:
</p>

<ol>
<li>  using conditional statements (e.g., <code> if, switch</code>),
<li>  using loops (e.g., initialization, iteration, condition testing, loop
  body with <code>for, while</code>), and
<li>  introducing motion with the Scribbler 2 robot.
</ol>

<h2>Some Project Options</h2>
<p>
Working in pairs, students should develop a program that includes these
elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Program controls robot such that the robot avoids obstacles in the room. </li>
<li>
Robot recalls the last two actions (currently done and the one one before that).</li>
<li>
If robot performs the same two turns in a row (e.g. two right turns), robot
beeps and turns around (instead of turning the third time). Note that this is only when there are two <i>turns</i>, so going forward or backward twice in a row does not count!</li>
<li>
Every ten actions, robot performs a short dance three times in a row (the dance can just be a few actions).</li>
<li>
At least two <code>if</code> statements</li>
<li>
At least three loops, at least one of which must be a <code>for</code> loop,
and at least one must be a <code>while</code> loop</li>.
</ul>

<p>
Together with the program, a student pair must write a paragraph that
describes what steps are needed to demonstrate the program is working
correctly (this can be pseudocode). Students should also recall that each of the labs in this module
used a different style. Write a paragraph describing the pros and cons of
each style as it helped you learn.
</p>

<h4>Project Submission</h4>

<p>
Here are some guidelines for this project:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The very first part of a program listing should indicate the authors of the
project (use a C comment).
<li>
The paragraph description of the project may be included in comments at the
start of the program, or it may be written as a separate document.
<ul>
<li>
If the description is included in the program, please place the paragraph
immediately after the authors' names.
<li>
If the description is separate, please be sure the authors's names are at
the top of the page.
</ul>
<li>
A copy of the program and description should be printed and turned in at
the start of class when the project is due.
<li>
A copy of the program and description also should be emailed to the
instructor at walker@cs.grinnell.edu by the start of the class when the
project is due.  In the email, please include the authors' names as well as
the project title in the subject line.

</ul>

<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>
This project will be worth 25 points, based on the following rubric:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Control of robot activities (5 points)
<li>
Inclusion of at least two <code>if</code> statements that impact the
functioning of the program (5 points)
<li>
Use of three loops (as specified) that control the program's processing (5
points) 
<li>
Neatness and conciseness of code (5 points)
<li>
Paragraphs about different styles attached (5 points)
</ul>
