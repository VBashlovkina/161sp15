<h1>Laboratory Exercise on Linked Lists</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>  

<p>
This laboratory helps you gain more experience with the use of lists and
pointers.
</p>

<h2> Steps for this Lab</h2>

<p>
This lab involves working with lists of data, using an existing driver
program which actually constructs the lists.  In particular, the file 
<a href="actionlist.c"><tt>actionlist.c</tt></a> contains a menu-driven program to maintain
a list of robot actions and their corresponding names.
</p>

<p>
As written, the program contains functions to insert an action on the list
(before a designated node), to delete a specified action from the list, to
print the actions in the list, and to execute all the actions in order. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Copy <a href="actionlist.c"><tt>actionlist.c</tt></a> to your account,
compile it, and run it several times to discover just what the program does. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Make sure you
turn the robot on before calling the E (execute) option.</em>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
As you may have discovered, in addition to the above features, program
<tt>actionlist.c</tt> contains several stubs for additional functions, but
details of these functions  are not given.  Your task in this lab is
to implement these new functions on the menu. (Don't forget to add the
prototype before <tt>main</tt> if you can write the functions at the bottom.)
</p>

<p>
<ol start=2>
<li>
<p>
Write the details for <i>countList (struct Node * first) </i>
which counts the number of items in the list.
</p>
<p>
To perform this task, you will want to move along the list item-by-item, 
counting the items as you go.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Write the details for <i>printLast (struct Node * first) </i>
which prints the name of the action for the last item on the list.
</p>
<p>
To perform this task, you will want to move along the list item-by-item, 
until you reach the last item on the list.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Write the details for function <i>printReverse (struct Node *first)</i>,
that prints the names in the actionData structures in the nodes from the
last node to the front. 
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Test your program to see if it works for different cases such as a null list.
	</ul>
<p>
<i>Hint:</i>  The C code can follow the same approach you used often in
Scheme (think recursively).
</p>
<li>
<p>
Write a function <tt>reverseActions</tt> that executes all the actions in
the list from the last node to the front.  This should be very similar to
<tt>printReverse</tt> except it will call the void functions stored in the
actionData structs rather than print out the names. 
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Again think about different cases that might occur and test for those.'
	</ul>
<p>
<em>*&nbsp;Note: You will also need to add a menu option for this function
  in main.</em>
</p>
</ol>

<!--
<h2>Extra Extra Credit!</h2>

<p>
You may have noticed the <tt>F</tt>, <tt>L</tt>, and <tt>R</tt> options are
still not implemented. 
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>
Complete these function stubs so you have a fully working robot movement
suite.  
</p>
<p>
<em>If you are having trouble, read the <tt>addAction</tt>
and <tt>deleteAction</tt> functions to see how modification of the list
nodes is handled.</em>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
It is important to realize a list node is identified by
its <tt>UID</tt> rather than the data it contains.  When asking and
searching for nodes, use the <tt>UID</tt> to match the node and not the
data field. 
</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>Why might a <tt>UID</tt> be used in this case rather than just the
    data that the list contains?
  </p>
</ol>
