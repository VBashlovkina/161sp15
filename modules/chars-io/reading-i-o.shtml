<h1>Notes on Reading Data</h1>

<h2>Readings</h2>

<p>
Be sure to read the following materials carefully:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>
Walker, <a href="/~walker/c/index.html">An Introduction to C Through
Annotated Examples</a>, Program 1 (<tt>quarts-1.c</tt>),  pages 1-3.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Reading from the textbook:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>
King, Chapter 3, pages 37-49, OR
</p>
<li>
<p>
Kernighan & Ritchie: 1.5, 7.1, 7.2, B.2 
</p>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p>
When a user enters information into a program, the user types a sequence of
characters.  Sometimes this information is intended to be a string of
characters, such as a name or an address.  In other applications, a
sequence of characters, such as 123.45, should be interpreted as a number.
</p>

<p>
When characters are to be considered as numbers, input can follow either of
two basic forms:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The program can proceed in two steps:  
</p>
<ol>
<li>
read the information as a sequence of characters
<li>
convert the character sequence to a number
</ol>

<li>
<p>
the program can rely upon a library function to perform both steps as one
logical operation.
</p>
</ul>

<p>
The library function <tt>scanf</tt> is commonly used for the latter
approach.  Using <tt>scanf</tt> involves several elements.  The basics of
this work are illustrated in the following code segment:
</p>

<pre><tt>
   double a, b;
   scanf  ("%lf", &amp;a);
   scanf  ("%lf", &amp;b);
</tt></pre>

<p>
As illustrated in this segment,

<ul>
<li>
The first parameter for <tt>scanf</tt> indicates the format of data to be
read.  
<ul>
<li>
Use <tt>%lf</tt> for double precision real numbers (<tt>lf</tt>
stands for "long float"), 
<li>
<tt>%f</tt> for single precision real numbers (floating point numbers), and
<li>
 <tt>%d</tt> for decimal integers.
</ul>
<li>
Use an ampersand &amp; before the variable to represent the "address" of
the variable (the location where the value should be stored).
<li>
When reading a number, <tt>scanf</tt> skips initial whitespace (spaces,
tabs, newline characters).
<li>
After skipping whitespace, <tt>scanf</tt> reads as long a string of digits
as it can to obtain a number.  Thus, if one enters <tt>123Walker</tt>, the
<tt>scanf</tt> statement will read the number as 123; "Walker" is not part
of a number, so reading of the number cannot proceed.
<li>
If <tt>scanf</tt> tries to read a number but encounters non-numeric data
after whitespace, then reading stops and the number is assigned the value
0.
<li>
The above code segment skips whitespace (if any), reads a first number (up
to whitespace or non-numeric data), and assigns the number read to
variable <tt>a</tt>.  This process then is repeated in reading variable
<tt>b</tt>. 
</ul>

<p>
<tt>scanf</tt> allows the two reading operations above to be combined
within a single statement as follows:
</p>

<pre><tt>
   double a, b;
   scanf  ("%lf%lf", &amp;a, &amp;b);
</tt></pre>

<p>
Beyond the identification of variables and formats for reading, the
<tt>scanf</tt> can specify other characters that must be part of the
input.  For example, suppose a program is supposed to read hours and
minutes in the format <tt>hour:minutes:seconds</tt>, such as
<tt>12:34:56</tt> or <tt>5:8:27</tt>.  In this setting, the user is
supposed to enter the colon character between integer numbers.  The
following code segment would perform such a read operation:
</p>

<pre><tt>
   int hr, min, sec;
   scanf ("%d:%d:%d", &amp;hr, &amp;min, &amp;sec);
</tt></pre>
