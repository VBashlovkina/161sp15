<p>
This course explores elements of computing that have reasonably close ties
to the architecture of computers, compilers, and operating systems.
The course takes an imperative view of problem-solving, supported by
programming in the C programming language.  Some topics include: 

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>imperative problem solving:</i>  top-down design, common algorithms, 
assertions, invariants
</p>

<li>
<p>
<i>C programming:</i> syntax and semantics, control structures, functions,
parameters, macro processing, compiling, linking, program organization
</p>

<li>
<p>
<i>concepts with data:</i> data abstraction, integer and floating-point
representation, string representation, arrays, unions, structures, linked
list data structures, stacks, and queues
</p>

<li>
<p>
<i>machine-level issues:</i>  data representation, pointers, memory management
</p>

<li>
<p>
<i>GNU/Linux operating system:</i>  commands, bash scripts, software
development tools
</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The underlying hardware and some software for this course are based on
research performed by the Institute for Personal Robots in Education
(IPRE), hosted at Georgia Tech and Bryn Mawr College. Their materials,
including software interfaces, reference materials, and hardware, were
funded by grants from Microsoft Research and the National Science
Foundation.  (wording modified from suggestions by Douglas Blank of the
IPRE project and Bryn Mawr College)

<h2>
<a name="textbooks">Textbook</a>
</h2>

<p>
Students in this course should have a ready reference for the C programming
language.  Some labs include only a brief discussion of a topic, and
students will need to do additional reading to understand the general
context and the details of the material.  Use of a textbook can be an
effective means to study this material in appropriate depth.

Planning and development of materials for this course represent an
extensive effort:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Preparation and refinement of the course's structure and materials exceed
2900 hours.
<li>
Course materials include over 100 Web pages involving over 39,000 lines of

<p>
Although the developers have read, re-read, and refined the materials
extensively, one can be confident that typographical errors remain.
</p>

<p>
If you find an error, if something does not read well, if deadlines on one

<p>
While the schedule for this course is expected to evolve, a 
Tentative Class Schedule is available at
<a href="schedule.php">schedule.php</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, a reasonably detailed, day-by-day outline of course work is
available through the base page for each module.
</p>


<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="coursework">Course Work</a>
</h2>

<p>
Course Work will involve a combination of several
activities.  <a href="coursework-notes.shtml">Submission details</a> vary
somewhat according to the type of the assignment.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="suppl-prob.shtml"> <b> Supplemental Problems</b></a> extend the
range of problems considered in the course and help sharpen problem-solving
skills. Through the semester, five supplemental problems will be
required.  Supplemental problems numbered 6 or above may be done for extra
credit, although extra credit may not raise a student's average on
assignments above 120%.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>  Supplemental Problems are to be done individually; students
should not talk to others in the class, Mentors, Lab Assistants, Technology
Consultants about these problems.  See for
example <a href="tutors-in-161.shtml">The Role of Tutors For Computer
  Science 161</a>.

<li>
<p>
<a href="schedule.php"> Module Laboratories and Projects:</a> 
Topics in this course are organized into eight modules and a few
supplementary labs.  Modules include laboratory sessions and conclude with
a integrative project.  
</p>

<p>
<i>Laboratory sessions</i> introduce specific features of Grinnell's computing
environment, highlight concepts and constructs introduced in class, allow
instructor assistance in a "hands-on" setting, and supplement normal office
hours.  Approximately four labs require a formal write-up, explaining what
work you have done, showing any programming you have done, indicating tests
or experiments run, and giving your conclusions.  Labs designated <i>
[Req] </i> on the <a href="schedule.php"> Tentative Class Schedule</a> are
required -- labs designated <i> [EC] </i> may be done for extra credit.  <u>In
order for extra-credit labs to provide reasonable benefit, any such lab
being submitted for credit must be turned in within 2 weeks of when it is
scheduled for coverage in class.</u>  As with written homework, extra credit
may not raise a student's average on laboratories above 120%.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>  As a special incentive for mastering the laboratory
  exercises, <i>between a third and a half of the problems on each test and
  on the exam will be taken from the laboratory exercises (with only slight
  editing).</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Projects:</i> Each of the eight modules concludes with a project,
involving both a computer program and associated commentary; and each
project is a required part of the course.
</p>

<p>
<i>Collaboration on labs and projects encouraged:</i>  Many lab activities
and projects should be done in groups of two or three, although you
may work individually on labs after Lab 8.  Only one write-up is expected
per group.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<b> Hour Tests: </b> Three hour tests are scheduled
for Friday, 19 September, Friday, 17 October, and Wednesday, 26 November.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<b> Exam: </b> Following the schedule distributed by the Registrar's
Office, the in-class final exam for this course is scheduled for 
Wednesday, December 17, at 9:00 am.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<b> Extra Credit Opportunities: </b> Computer science is a wide-ranging
discipline, and courses can cover only selected pieces.  To encourage
students to expand their horizons, students may earn 2 points extra credit
for each <i>Thursday Extra</i> or other departmental talk, by attending the
talk and writing a short (4-8 sentence) summary or response.  Logistically,
<u>a reasonable statement must be submitted via e-mail to the instructor
<b>within 1 week</b> of the talk</u>; after the e-mail has been reviewed
and the statement deemed appropriate, the student will receive 1 point
extra credit counted toward supplemental problems and 1 point extra credit
counted toward labs.  Additional extra credit opportunities may be
announced through the semester.
</p>

</ul>

<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="deadlines">Dates, Deadlines</a>
</h2> 

<p>
Grinnell College offers alternative options to complete academic work for
students who reserve religious holy days.  Please contact me within the
first three weeks of the semester if you would like to discuss a specific
instance that applies to you.
</p>

<p>
Normally, laboratory write-up, project, or program is due every third class
meeting.  Laboratory exercises, projects, and supplemental problems all
require work to be submitted via email
to <tt>grader-161-01@cs.grinnell.edu</tt> and in paper form.  Both of these
must be received before the stated deadline.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The time stamp on email to <tt>grader-161-01@cs.grinnell.edu</tt>
will be checked for timeliness.
<li>
Paper must be turned in under my door ahead of time or turned in as
designated in class.
</ul>

<p>
It is expected that the materials submitted electronically will match the
materials submitted in paper form.  Discrepancies may raise questions of
academic dishonesty and be subject to review by the Committee on Academic
Standing. 

<p>
Deadlines are shown on the <a href="schedule.php"> Tentative Class
Schedule</a> , and <u><i>work is due at the start of each class
specified</i></u>.  A penalty of 25% per class meeting will be assessed for
any assignment turned in late, even work submitted in the middle or the end
of a class.  For example, paper printed at the start of class will
inevitable be turned in after the start of a class, and thus will
be considered late. Print your materials well before the start of class!
</p>

<p>
<i>Exceptions to the deadline policy and its penalties:</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
An extension of at least one class period is automatically
granted if the department's Linux network is down for an unscheduled period
of three or more hours during the week preceding the assignment.
<li>
Difficulties sometimes arise with printing through PaperCut.  When such
difficulties arise, you should contact the instructor (either at the start
of class or via email).  Note, however, that difficulties with PaperCut do
not impact deadlines for emailing materials.
<li>
Students arriving late to a class should turn in the paper form of the work
as soon as they arrive in the classroom.  In such cases, the assignment
will be considered on time if the email submission was received before the
class began.
</uL>
 

<h3><a name="illness">Emergencies, Illness</a></h3>
<p>
Although dates for labs, programming assignments, tests, and the final exam
are firm, I understand that circumstances arise when you are not able to
attend class.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When circumstances are known ahead of time (e.g., academic activities,
athletic events), I expect you to make arrangements with me before the
activity occurs.  Normally, we will identify an alternative date for the
due date or test.
<li>
When circumstances cannot be reasonably anticipated (e.g., illness, family
emergencies, serious injury), I expect you to notify me as soon as is
reasonably possible. (Email is fine.)
In the case of medical problems that require you to miss several classes, I
expect a written note from a medical professional or counselor that
indicates that your health interfered with the course activity.  (I do not
need to know any details of the medical problem, but I do need to know that
you sought help and that the medical professional believed meeting the
deadline would likely interfere with your health.)
</ul>

<p>
<b>Absolute Deadline: </b> <i> All homework must be turned in by Friday, 12
December at 5:00 pm; </i><br> laboratory reports, projects, or programs
received after that time will not be counted in the grading of the course.
<p>


<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="collaboration">Collaboration</a>
</h2> 

<p>
Collaboration often will be allowed on laboratory exercises and problems
from the textbook, but collaboration normally will NOT be allowed on
supplemental problems and tests.  To avoid confusion, the rules for
collaboration on homework are included in the specification of each
assignment.
</p>

<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="pair-responsibilities">Pair Responsibilities</a>
</h2> 

<p>
Work on labs and projects in this course is often done collaboratively (in
pairs, occasionally in a group of three).  Many studies suggest substantial
benefits to learning with this type of group work.  However, to be
successful, collaboration requires partners to actively participate.

<ul>
<li>
Each partner should come to class and actively participate throughout the
class session.
<li>
Partners should make arrangements to meet as needed in the lab outside of
class to finish labs or projects.
<li>
Each partner has an obligation to show up and actively participate during
out-of-class, planned sessions.
</ul>

<p>
Failure to meet one's responsibilities to a group not only impacts the
individual, but also impedes the education of the partner.  Thus, except in
exceptional circumstances  (e.g., illness, family emergencies, serious
injury), failure to follow through with one's responsibilities as a partner
may have a significant on one's course grade and/or one's standing in the
course.
See <a href="../pair-programming.shtml#responsibilities">Responsibilities</a>
for pair programming for details.
</p>


<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="honesty">Academic Honesty</a>
</h2>
<p>
All work in this course is governed by the rules of the college regarding
academic honesty.  In summary, standard practice requires that you must
acknowledge all ideas from others.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
When working on homework, either individually or in a group, you may use
any written source.  However, the normal rules of citation must be
followed, as described in the <i>Student Handbook</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must cite statements in the textbook, if you use them to guide your
work.
<li>
Although the Web can be useful for reference, you are
advised that much material on the Web is of poor quality.
<li>
You are responsible for the quality of what you turn
in, regardless of the source of the material. 
</ul>
<li>
<p>
When you work in a group on an activity, the names of all students in the
group should appear at the top of the first page.  Turning in work with
multiple people listed as authors implies that all members of the group
agree with what is presented.  If a group member does not agree with some
part of the work, the group should continue to discuss and revise the
material until agreement is achieved.  In summary, a group activity is a
joint effort, and all group members have equal responsibility for the
finished product.
</p>
<li>
<p>
When you work on an activity yourself, but consult others, then you should
include a statement identifies whom you consulted on what material.  This
includes conversations with class members, tutors, lab assistants, other
students, faculty, and any other people involved.  If you consulted one
person on several parts on an assignment, you may summarize the collective
help in an "Acknowledgment Section" rather on the individual problems
&mdash; as long as the work makes clear who helped on what.  Overall, all
consultations on problems must be cited for each problem or exercise.
</p>
</ul>

<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="cell-phones">Cell Phones, Text Messaging, and E-Community Devices</a>
</h2>

<p>
Cell phones, text-messaging devices, and other social-networking
connections may not be used in this class.   If you bring such equipment to
the classroom, it must be turned off before the class starts and stay off
throughout the class period.  Use of such equipment is distracting to those
nearby and will not be tolerated.
</p>

<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="accommodations">Accommodations</a>
</h2>

<P>

If you have specific physical, psychiatric, or learning disabilities 
and require accommodations, please let me know early in the semester so 
that your learning needs may be appropriately met.  You will need to 
provide documentation of your disability to the Director of Academic
Advising.  Feel free to talk to me if you have questions or want more
information.
</p>

<!--...................................................................-->
<h2>
<a name="grading">Grading</a>
</h2> 

<p>
This instructor's grading philosophy dictates that the final grade should
ultimately be based upon each student's demonstration of her or his
understanding of the material, not on the performance of the class as a
whole nor on a strict percentile basis.  The following scheme is proposed
as a base for how the various assignments and tests will be counted in the
final grade.
