Converting CSC 161 Fall HTML Pages to Spring HTML Pages

1.  Header

    a.  Check the style sheet refers to style.css
    b.  Check that the title reflects an appropriate title, likely similar
    to the h1 heading at the beginning of the document

2.  Main Body
 
    a.  The body should begin with

<body>
<div class="body">
<!--#include file="header.inc"-->

<div class="labcontent">

    b.  Close the "labcontent" class just before the <hr> tag near the bottom
    of the page.

</div> <!-- labcontent-->

3.  Fix the URL section by putting it in the footer class and address
class (substituting the correct page URL:

<div class="footer">
<hr>

<p>
This document is available on the World Wide Web as
</p>

<div class="address">
<PRE>
     http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/courses/161.sp12/index.shtml
</PRE>
</div> <!-- address -->

    Note that <PRE> is adequate; no need for <BLOCKQUOTE>, etc.

4.  Footer/Updating Information

    a.  Add lines for the revision.  For example:

   <em>created created 4 January 1998 by Henry M. Walker</em><br>
   <em>last revised 18 August 2009 by Henry M. Walker</em>

    might become


   <em>created created 4 January 1998 by Henry M. Walker</em><br>
   <em>full revision 18 August 2009 by Henry M. Walker</em><br>
   <em>last revised 7 September 2011 by Henry M. Walker</em>

   b.  The contact information should be:

<tr><td>
   For more information, please contact 
   <a class="footer-a" href="/~walker/">Henry M. Walker</a> at
   <a  class="footer-a" href="mailto:walker@cs.grinnell.edu">walker@cs.grinnell.edu</a>.
   </tr>

    Note that "class="footer-a" is added to two href tags.

   c. Close the footer with two lines just before </body>

</div> <!-- footer -->
</div> <!-- body -->
</body>
</html>


5.  General style/format

    Main titles (after the page title) will use <h2> headers

    Subtitles (within h2) headers) will use <h3> headers

    Subsubtitles (within h3 headers) will use <h4> headers

    Steps for the lab will be within sections (with <h2>, <h3>, or <h4>
    headers).  The headers should identify the main topic under
    consideration for the steps.

    Main steps for lab work will be numbered 1, 2, 3, ... consecutively
    throughout the entire lab --- with numbering continuing to increase
    from section to section.

6.  Final Checking
    Each page should be checked for spelling
    Each page should be validated against the W3C HTML standards
