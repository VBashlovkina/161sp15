/* This program illustrates an appropriate header for Supplemental
   Problem 1 for CSC 161, Fall 2014
   The final program is supposed to convert an amount in British pounds
   and pence to U.S. dollars and cents.

   Pre-condition:  factors have been identified at the start of the program
                   the values of pounds and pense are non-negative
   Post-condition: the program prints equivalent number of dollars and cents,
                   the number of bills of each denomination, and the number
                   of cents in change
